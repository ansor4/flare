# Getting Started with Flare

_Flare_ is the codename for the iphone splash page website iphone.artsy.net.

## Install Node.js

It is recommended to use the [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) tool to manage node versions and install node.

First install NVM. See [this page](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for latest information.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.1/install.sh | bash
```

Reopen a shell and install node.js.

```
nvm install 8
```

Then tell nvm to use the latest version of node by default and to update your PATH.

```
nvm alias default 8
```

## Install Node Modules

```
yarn install
```

Although not necessary, it's recommended to install mocha and coffeescript globally for debugging.

```
npm install mocha -g
npm install coffee-script -g
```

## Run the Server

Run the server, and open flare at [localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003).

```
make s
```
